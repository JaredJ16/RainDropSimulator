Rain Drop Simulator is a GUI program that simulates rain falling onto a glass window.

Current Status:

The program can currently generate raindrops of random sizes and place them in valid locations on the display. Also, the program features a built in version of collision detection made for ellipses. See the Rain Drop Simulator Ellipse Collision Demo video to visually see what the program can do.



Future Additions:

-A function will be added so that when raindrops collide, they merge together so that the overall mass of the system is conserved.
-Basic movement mechanics will be added such as gravity, friction, and conservation of momentum.
-A custom data structure (QuadTree/Quaternary Tree) will be added to reduce the amount of checks needed to be done for collision detection.
-Settings will be added to modify certain features such as the rain rate, the color of the rain drops, and a button that reverses the direction of gravity.
